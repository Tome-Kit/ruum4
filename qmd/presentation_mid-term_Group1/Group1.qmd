## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Interdisciplinarity

-   Mostly based on knowledge of mathematics
-   SDG fact implementation added social discipline
-   Own field of study - by use of facts for tasks, not to directly influence the project

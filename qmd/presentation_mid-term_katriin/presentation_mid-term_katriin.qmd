## BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

*Teach the goals of sustainable development through study tracks

*Pay more attention to SDG

*World devastating situation

*Trails availability

*Increasing physical activity

*Out of the box thinking


## IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES

*Different phases and tasks.

*Assignments are entered into MathCityMap.

*Rules we had to follow and the points that had to be observed.

*The final result of the project -tracks where tasks include mathematics, various sustainable development goals, outdoor object and a studyfield.

## MathCityMap

## STAKEHOLDERS OF THE PROJECT

*Trails can be used by all people who are willing and interested.

*Teachers or youth workers offering non-formal learning opportunity.

## BASIS OF RESEARCH

*Research papers and various scientific articles in ETERA.

*Reliable sources, have used it before.

## INTERDISCIPLINARITY

*By including the knowledge of different studyfields I can approach the solution of the problem from different perspectives.

*Different web pages during the project.

*RStudio program and through it we have also learned the R markdown language.

## TIMEFRAME OF THE PROJECT

*At the beginning of the first semester - different trails to get more ideas.

*In the middle of the semester - creating our own track assignments.

*Second semester - mainly working on correction and improvement.

## PROJECT MID-TERM RESULTS
*Six assignments that currently have a quality level of 1.

*In the future, it is necessary to improve the tasks sufficiently so that they reach the required quality level. 

## OpenProject

## PROJECT (GROUP) MID-TERM RESULTS
Six assignments that currently have a quality level of 1.
In the future, it is necessary to improve the tasks sufficiently so that they reach the required quality level. When the track is ready for testing, it is necessary to find suitable testers.

## Task management
